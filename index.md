<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px;">Project 1 - Designing Interactive Ad for Sustainability</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0em;">September 24, 2019</h5>
### Background

We observed that there is little to none reduce paper usage campaigns on campus, and the few that are related are unidirectional and dull. This comes as a surprise to us because we thought this would be an obvious place to start a sustainability campaign, especially since trees have an important role in nature's carbon cycle, hence the amount of trees is directly impacting our fight to save our planet. Therefore, we decided we would be the ones who start a tree-saving campaign.



### Goal

Our goal is to encourage all students to reduce unnecessary printing. To achieve that, we listed out four criteria, which are user-friendly, educational, impactful and feasible.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px;">About Me</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0em;">September 20, 2019</h5>
I am a Year 4 student major in Computer Science at **HKUST**. Coming to realise this is my last semester here, I couldn't help but wonder what I can do to get the best out of it. And this is the very reason why I choose COMP4461, Human-Computer Interaction, as it is one of the few courses that sounds genuinely interesting.

I am the co-founder of **Travezer LLC**, which is a US tech startup with members from the United States, Germany and Hong Kong. Our main focus is to help young travellers plan their multi-destination trips. Our product is centred around the most powerful multi-destination trip planning tool on the market developed by our founding members. Our product will be in beta soon, so feel free to approach me if you want to try it out.
