<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px;">Project 1 - Designing Interactive Ad for Sustainability</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0em;">September 24, 2019</h5>
I am a Year 4 student major in Computer Science at **HKUST**. Coming to realise this is my last semester here, I couldn't help but to think what I can do to get the best out of it. And this is the reason why I choose COMP4461, Human-Computer Interaction, as it is one of the few courses that genuinely sounds interesting.

I would love to share a video ([Do What You Can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE)) from my favourite YouTuber *Casey Neistat*, which has strongly influenced how I view challenges. The gist of the video is that you have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone, and to realise there is a lot more to explore.
