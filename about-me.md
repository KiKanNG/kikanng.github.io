I am a Year 4 student major in Computer Science at **HKUST**. Coming to realise this is my last semester here, I couldn't help but wonder what I can do to get the best out of it. And this is the very reason why I choose COMP4461, Human-Computer Interaction, as it is one of the few courses that sounds genuinely interesting.

I am the co-founder of **Travezer LLC**, which is a US tech startup with members from the United States, Germany and Hong Kong. Our main focus is to help young travellers plan their multi-destination trips. Our product is centred around the most powerful multi-destination trip planning tool on the market developed by our founding members. Our product will be in beta soon, so feel free to approach me if you want to try it out.

I would love to share a video ([Do What You Can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE)) from my favourite YouTuber *Casey Neistat*, who has strongly influenced how I view challenges. The gist of the video is that you have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone and to boldly go where no man has gone before.


### My Summer

Travelled solo in Europe for 6 weeks and I would do it again in a heartbeat. The photo below was taken when I was travelling in Copenhagen, where I reunited with friends I made studying abroad. If you want to listen to my travel stories, don't hesitate to ask me after class :)
