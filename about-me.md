I am a Year 4 student major in Computer Science at **HKUST**. Coming to realise this is my last semester here, I couldn't help but to think what I can do to get the best out of it. And this is the reason why I choose COMP4461, Human-Computer Interaction, as it is one of the few courses that genuinely sounds interesting.

I would love to share a video ([Do What You Can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE)) from my favourite YouTuber *Casey Neistat*, which has strongly influenced how I view challenges. The gist of the video is that you have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone, and to realise there is a lot more to explore.


### My Summer

Travelled solo in Europe for 6 weeks and I would do it again in a heartbeat. The photo below was taken when I was travelling in Copenhagen, where I reunited with friends I made studying abroad.
